There has to be valid, statistical evidence of the need for a recall. It takes time for public health data to be aggregated, and it takes time for local/regional health authorities to notice an increase in certain diseases or illnesses, etc. All of this data has to (typically) be fed into a state/provincial health authority and then into the hands of an agency like Health Canada. \n\nSometimes recalls happen as a result of testing and products are recalled immediately or simply not released into sales channels.

They give instructions to legislative clerks who then find the exact spot in the bill and any reference to another law. That said, I saw someone mention that AI was used to generate the amendments so it\u2019s not clear to what extend legislative clerks were involved here but usually amendments are individually assigned a number and such which isn\u2019t easy to do when you get either 20,000 pdfs or a word document with 20,000 randomly generated amendments. There\u2019s also usually verification to make sure amendments are procedurally admissible, order them in the proper order they need to be voted on.

Presumably some of that is top loaded, but how much should people who run a 2 billion dollar organisation get paid (and how much do they get paid)?\n\nWith a budget shortfall of 125 million dollars, you're not going to get there cancelling 16 million dollars in bonuses.

        "body": "> Protests in the past were not upper-middle-class kids blocking random roads or throwing a can of soup on a painting to protest something completely unrelated.\n\nProtests/revolutions/movements have always been run by intellectuals and the disaffected bourgeois (middle class). They have the most to gain and the most to lose. Very rarely have peasant revolts resulted in changes throughout history. Intellectuals have always driven these movements and always will. If you want to recruit people to a social cause you need to also be educated about that social cause and be able to persuade others to join you. \n\n> soup on a painting\n\nIf you bothered to [research](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11178933/Just-Stop-Oil-protesters-hidden-tunnel-near-oil-depot-removed-THIRTEEN-days.html) these groups you would have learned they were simultaneously protesting politicians and O&G companies. It got almost NO press coverage compared to their other viral campaigns. \n\nIt's funny that's your only frame of reference for protests in Paris. Paris has a super long history of protest and civil disobedience and not everybody agrees with every protest. Yet, they still have less negative connotations with activism as a whole. Strange they can differentiate between effective and ineffective modes of protest without giving a blanket negative association with the term \"activist\". Why can't Canadians do the same thing?\n\n\n> Canadian activists are fucking idiots, like I said before. It's not the protests it's the protestors. They have become like cults where only the dumbest in the population join.\n\nYou should be more mad at the person who told you to believe this than any protest I'm sure you've been massively inconvenienced by. I'm sure most Canadians can count the times they have been inconvenienced by protestors on 1 hand. A non-problem.\n\nand again what ACTUALLY makes a Canadian protester so much different than a protestor at any other point in history in any other country? People have been blocking streets for centuries yet it's only become a problem for many Canadians in the last few years. Whos interests are served by creating a population who is too scared to protest or be associated with \"activism\"? NOT YOURS.\n\nYou have also given a negative blanket association to a group of thousands of diverse people across Canada who protest for many reasons. I love how you have this cute little narrative about thousands of Canadians that makes it so easy for you to justify your hate towards them. Isn't that so convenient?\n\nI'm starting to think you base your opinions on what you see on Reddit. Stop letting other people do your thinking for you.",

What's the punishment when this is found out? How often are people able to get away with it? If there are low levels of enforcement, and the punishments when discovered aren't that bad... then people are more likely to do it.  I would suggest that the government needs to do more if this is the case, while not taking blame away from the landlord for their own actions.\n\n> He did it because dishonest, rich and powerful people told him to, and now the government will take all the blame for the consequences.\n\nYou're acting like he's not part of that class.  I _do not_ want either the PPC or the CPC in power, but I'm not necessarily happy with Trudeau either.  He won his first election on a platform that included election reform... which he then flatly refused to do once in office.  He didn't even try to by sly about it and have the committee that was formed to look into it just say \"no need to change.\"  They literally said, \"this is what we should do,\" and he said, \"yea. I'll just do nothing.\"  He's not some ignorant idiot being played with by the Illuminati or something.\n\nI do get what you're saying here.  There are people in Canada that are financially benefitting from the immigrants coming here.  I just don't think that Trudeau is a moron that can't see that.  He's complicit... and so would people like Pierre if he becomes the PM too.  They are all in the same class, and view regular people through a distorted lens.\n\n> Trudeau didn't bring in more people because he likes immigrants.\n\nI'd say that he's probably doing it because of the idea that we need more people in Canada to maintain a certain level of GDP, tax revenue, etc.  The issue that I have is that we really need to solve our housing issues before going gungho on the immigration.  We're having issues with our current population levels, so attempting to increase those levels isn't going to make the problem resolve itself faster. It's working against it.",

Not only that, but private galen-weston owned pharmacies are being paid 7k a month in overhead support, while the government has never and *would never* do the same for physicians. \n\nPrimary care is dying because we expect to outsource the cost of running it while not funding it appropriately. Physicians are seeing the writing on the wall and avoiding community family medicine like the plague; and government continually doubles down on bandaid solutions.",

        "body": ">You dont need vitamin injections. Oral supplements are more than adequate. Sure some people may be SO deficient they need an injection, but for most people, a cheap OTC vitamin works just fine.\n\nThis is the crux right here - you are simply wrong about this. The really cheap OTC oral stuff that isn't even suspended in an oil doesn't get absorbed at all by most people, and the more expensive stuff that's in oil with Vitamin K as well still isn't absorbed well by some people. I can take 10,000 IU of the \"good\" stuff a day and it will hardly budge the number on the bloodwork. That works out to ~300,000 IU a month, which I only mention because 250,000 IU injected once a month does actually move the bloodwork. And the difference in cost only works out to about $15 more each month for the injections. \n\n>Vitamin infusions are overall a waste of money from an empiric standpoint. Unless you are severely deficient, you are just creating expensive pee. Usually what makes you feel better is the rehydration from the IV fluids and/or placebo effect.\n\nDepends what exactly you're getting, there are studies supporting intravenous Vitamin C being beneficial, even for people who aren't deficient. And I don't think its just rehydration. I usually drink 5 litres of water a day, on top of whatever milk, juice, coffee, soda, etc. I might have with meals. My piss is cleaner than the toilet water. I'm pretty much always well hydrated. I've also gotten saline drips when I actually was dehydrated, I know that feeling and its not what I mean. The effect I described previously also lasts several days\n\n>Naturopaths are not medical doctors. Their understanding of the nuances here are limited, their understanding of disease processes is almost non existent.\n\nNo, but I'm hardly suggesting naturopaths replace doctors either. They're supplemental. If I start pissing blood for no apparent reason I'm going to talk to a doctor. If I get diagnosed with cancer, I'm not relying on a naturopath to beat it. Every naturopath I've seen would tell their patients exactly the same. But they do fill gaps that medical doctors either can't or won't address, especially around things that are more \"quality of life\" than \"life or death\". This is particularly valuable in Canada, where an old foot injury that's just annoying but not crippling, or a borderline Vitamin D deficiency that isn't bad enough to cause any serious problems but does cause some smaller ones, is simply not worth the very limited time of the doctors available. \n\n>The question here is who should be able to call themselves doctor when it comes to health.\n\nWe call Psychologists \"doctor\" and frankly I put a lot more stock in Naturopathy than I do that discipline. I do get where you're coming from though. I think there's far more to be concerned about in the world of homeopaths and chiropractors though.",

The M\u00e9tis Nation of Saskatchewan owns two small plots of land to the north, one of which is used as the site for the Back to Batoche cultural festival in the summer, and one plot on the western side of the river, adjacent to the site. Other land around the river that is not on-reserve is owned privately by farmers, most of whom are not Indigenous but have very good relationships with both Parks and the Indigenous communities.\n\nThe plan is to actually move the bison to different plots of land depending on the time of year. During the summer, when the historical sites are open for tours, the bison will be moved to the land to the west of the site, across the river, where they\u2019re plainly visible for visitors, but tourists won\u2019t be able to physically interact with them (MNS and Parks really don\u2019t want anyone getting trampled like out at Yellowstone in the states). So even though the bison will be \u201cpart\u201d of the park, they physically won\u2019t be on parks land, they\u2019ll be on MNS land.\n\nThe herd is going to be managed very much like the bison at Grasslands National Park and Wanusk\u00eawin Heritage Park. Individual animals will be harvested periodically, but the herd will be allowed to grow, with the hope being that the population at Batoche can eventually produce animals to be sent elsewhere, especially to M\u00e9tis communities in Saskatchewan.\n\nCattle farming is very common in the region, and speaking to lots of the local farmers this summer, a lot of them are very excited to have the buffalo at the park.

Ranked ballot(also called instant runoff or the alternative vote) also maintains local representation and avoids party lists(ie bad MPs can be booted even if the party doesn't kick them out).\n\nI do think that ranked choice should be combined with government election funding based off of the first round vote share because it encourages everyone to vote and to vote their conscience .",

        "body": "It's worth remembering that CSIS was specifically created because the RCMP acting both as an intelligence agency and as a law enforcement agency blurred a lot of lines and led them to trying to cover up a lot of shady shit they were doing.\n\nThe issue isn't really that they don't have teeth. Giving them teeth would essentially mean allowing them to carry out law enforcement in the shadows, shielding the limiting of rights from public scrutiny and basically throwing due process and your own rights out the window. Trudeau did give them limited threat disruption abilities in bill C-59, which was fairly controversial at the time and there are still concerns with them as the accountability mechanisms are hard to see, although they are better than before. Threat disruption is usually short term solutions like blocking a call or substituting an explosive with a dud, it's not going to help to actually make sure people are charged.\n\nCSIS can already share information with the RCMP and the RCMP can act as law enforcement. The problem is either their intelligence collection practices won't actually hold up in court or they don't want to share their sources and methods, creating a problem in converting intelligence to evidence, and Canadians have a constitutional right to hear the case being made against them in court including the evidence being used (Stinchcombe disclosure).\n\nThe best use of energy would be to actually attempt to codify Stinchcombe to create clear legal rules that would give CSIS certainty on what information they share is and isn't protected from disclosure, and addressing the inefficient two-court system that has come from this which creates a back and forth process where a federal judge looks as the evidence being withheld on national security grounds and the trial judge has to decide if the trial without the evidence is enough to work with and be convinced that the defendant's rights weren't violated in the process. The back and forth of this system is very long and often ends up in cases getting thrown out due to it taking so long.\n\nAlso our interference laws likely also need revision, but they're also very difficult to find language that will hold up well in various cases. The article points out that in only one of those cases the language clearly crossed a legal threshold, but then the intelligence to evidence issues came up. There are Canadian laws that prevent foreigners from incurring expenses to promote or oppose a candidate, but the people in Canada doing the donations are likely Chinese Canadians who have a democratic right to political speech and association. If someone a Canadian supports says they like a candidate, even they aren't Canadian, says they like someone, Canadians are still in their right listen to them and exercise their democratic will.\n\nThere are also laws against indue influence on voters, but there are exceptions for simply expressing an opinion on a preferred outcome, and it's hard to determine what the right language would be for those kinds of laws. I think the Bernie Sanders and Obama endorsements we see every election are very inappropriate, but at the same time I don't see our legal system prosecuting them for it leading to diplomatic issues.",

In the same manner that some provincial parties, like the Newfoundland Liberals and Nova Scotia Liberals are official provincial wings of the LPC.\n\nExcept that they aren't. There are links between membership and similar politics of provincial and federal parties based on a shared history, but officially they are not affiliated with one another. That is the same reason why the BC NDP platform often is not in line with the federal NDP (see things like environmental policy) or why the BC Liberal party (now United) has had a Conservative platform since the early 2000s. Parties at the federal and provincial levels are thus only loosely similar based on similar platforms that share a common intertwined history. \n\nGoing back to your point about the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia Liberals, the are for sure politically affiliated from a platform perspective. Now take a step back and realise that platform affiliation and being the same organisation are two very separate things. Officially as entities they are distinct from one another and even in the case of shared organisational structures, such as say with the provincial and federal NDP parties with their shared membership list (officially run exclusively by the provincial/territorial parties), the official entities and caucuses are separate and run distinct platforms (see environmental and economic policy clash among the John Hogan lead BC NDP and Jagmeet Singh federal NDP as an example or the Alberta NDP clash earlier this year).\n\nThe example I used is just the NDP which is the most organisationally connected political platform at the provincial and federal levels. Compare that with say the Liberals and only a handful of smaller (Atlantic) provinces are affiliated with their federal counterpart from a platform and/or organisational perspective, while remaining separate entities. The Liberal parties of all major provinces (ie. BC, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta) have long since disassociated with the federal party and have very distinct platforms and policy (again see BC Liberals as an example). Compare that with the Conservatives and they have basically zero affiliation outside of a shared membership group due to similar politics, because the CPC only formed in 2004 which was after the predecessors (PC and Alliance) had already disaffiliated at the provincial and federal levels in the 90s.\n\nI suggest you look up the history of provincial and federal parties in Canada because what you state has not been the case since the early 1990s, when parties were delinked at both levels. The Conservarives have zero formal ties to any provincial party. The Liberals have formal ties to provincial parties in most provinces and as stated previously are even organisationally tied somewhat in smaller (Altantic) provinces. The NDP which has their membership base tied to their provincial counterparts still remain distinct and fully autonomous entities, with the exception of the Quebec NDP with which they share some formal organisational links (and a good part of their caucus, unlike with other provincial NDP parties).",

On top of this, all these transactions are heavily taxed leading to even more economic gain for our country. If we lose these sources of foreign revenue, our institutions will want to reclaim the massive amounts of yearly income they are used to receiving in order to operate which will force them to greatly raise the tuition fees for citizens wishing to attend.

It doesn't help demographics directly( indirectly it does as he also has 3 kids who are paying taxes). They want young people who will lower the median age and will pay taxes for a long long time. Hence, importing international students em mass. This started when Jason Kenny was the immigration minister. Bring in loads of International students, tighten the federal PR process. This was they could give more provincial nominee PRs and have these kids move to the provinces that need them. Even if 10 go and then 5 stay after their PR, they can populate whichever province they want. Lots of friends settled in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova scotia etc. \n\nWhat they didn't account for was that economy is so shit there, not 5 out of 10 but maybe 2 out of 10 stay. Sometime even less.

I don't know what that means now, but back in 1990 it typically meant the policies in question are in opposition to each other.\n\nSo if the Federal Govt came out with an immigration law that was to stop aliens from gaming the system by using \"diploma-mill colleges\", say by limiting foreign students to only publicly funded institutions, there is no doubt in my mind that it would be allowed to happen. There are only 24 colleges, and 22 universities, as well as 3 technical institutes, in Ontario for example that would apply.

        "body": "TL:DR - a lot of stupid math and, at the end of the day, we're still blaming the wrong people for this.\n\nTo start - no, the VCMI conclude that 10% of the *calculated value* of the total waste is done at the grocery store level.  It roughly breaks down that the value multiplier at that level is ~200% - meaning that a dollar of wasted produce there is calculated at 2$ in total value.\n\nPage 17 has the waste as a % of total volume (and I will concede that you're right - bouncing between $ value and weight causes issues here).  \n\n>Average loss (shrink) in produce, meat, and seafood in retail stores is 5 to 6%, 3 to 4%, and 2 to 3.5%, respectively.\n\nThis would align with my third link which is, for the record, by the same group and by the same lead author (Dr. Martin V. Gooch - or 'the Goochster' as he's known by close friends), which indicate that about 1.1MM tons of waste, or ~4%, happening at the retail level.  It also provides $ value and tonnage, which is nice.\n\n\nNow, I will concede a priori - this doesn't prove that grocery stores are donating at all.  But, we can do some math and test that part out, if we presume the information [here](https://foodbankscanada.ca/securing-national-food-donations-through-the-retail-food-program/) is correct, based on what these retailers have already delivered, and promised to deliver.\n\n\nPer [this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-vast-majority-of-food-waste-takes-place-within-the-food-industry-and/), 1.1 million tons of retail food is wasted.  Let's also presume that the 32% of that which is identified as 'could be used' as identified here applies evenly to all actors.  32% of 1.1 million tons.  If we assume a short ton (2000 lbs to a ton), that's 2,200,000,000 pounds total.  \n\n32% of 2,200,000,000 is 704,000,000 pounds of food.  That's all grocery stores salvageable produce.  Loblaws and shoppers drug combine (which is itself unfair since doesn't waste much produce, but just for ease of calcs we'll keep it in) for 28% of the [total retail grocery market](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+of+the+total+grocery+market+are+loblaws+and+walmart&oq=how+much+of+the+total+grocery+market+are+loblaws+and+walmart&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigAdIBCTE0MDQ5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  If waste is distributed evenly, they should make up 28% of the total waste.  704,000,000*.28=~200,000,000 lbs of wastage, attributable to Loblaw's.\n\n\nLoblaws has committed to providing 1 billion lbs (1,000,000,000) to food banks by 2028.  Which would average to 200,000,000 lbs of food a year, over 5 years, from 2023 to 2028.  Which is almost exactly the number.  \n\nNow, I'll be honest - I don't have any faith that Loblaws will hit that lofty number,  but even if they fall short by 50%, that's still a roughly 50% diversion of what they could have wasted, going to people in need (and, side note, god bless you if you read this wall of text - feel free to respond with the word 'alfalfa' and I'll make good on that promise to donate 50 bucks to a food bank out of good will).\n\nAnywho - in summary - and at least to me (take from this what you may) is an indication that we really shouldn't be pinning this on evil grocery store CEOs when we're actually talking largely about a processing and manufacturing issue in wastage.",

Usually when you pull this move it can take up to a week since there is a back and forth debate.  \n\nI don't think this is going to have the intended effect Pierre wanted, getting your enemies together in a room and subjecting them to an all-nighter while you go on a PR tour is a not exactly a sound political tactic. Also coming back from that PR tour and once again sitting in the House to stare at a bunch of pissed off House Members is a pretty shitty move considering you had just enjoyed a steak dinner.\n\nPersonally prefer my enemies to be apart and divided. Not stuck together eating from the late night pizza and finding common ground. He may think \"hah got em.\"\n\nBut you can ask Paul Martin what happens when the BQ and the NDP hate you. That's when you open the door to some backchannel inter-party moves.\n\nOh by the way since they were actually voting on budget line items and not the \"carbon tax\" all of this passed through anyways since it was already vetted a month ago.",

Clearly Gaza is a case of 'uncommonly recognized genocide' with numbers of 10k deaths per month\n\npoking at this article aside, there isn't clear evidence of 'genocidal intent' yet to meet the ICC legal threshold, but the red flags are all there and the humanitarian crisis is horrendous\n\nIDF needs to do much much more to protect civilians in Gaza",

To reach the same % of population killed in the Holocaust (60%) it would take Israel about 15 years of killing at the current rate.

They have double the world average in growth rate. \n(That's why 40% of them are children. I know it's easy to assume it's because Israel killed all the adults, but no.

Israel left it entirely and forcibly removed their citizens from there in 2006 and no one was allowed back. \nYou're conflating the West Bank here, which you literally just argued against doing that.

When you take that into account, you see over a hundred thousand Palestinians have been displaced in the past 10 years.\n\nI think simply pointing out the hula hoops you have to jump through to try and obfuscate what's happening, only to arrive at the claim \"only a few hundred civilians are killed a year\" really highlights how horrific the treatments of Palestinians is.\n\nThink about what your comment says to the un-brainwashed.\n\n*\"If you ignore the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians we've maimed, the hundreds of thousands we've displaced by destroying their homes through the bombing of civilian areas, and the tens of thousands we've taken prisoner, its actually not that bad\"*\n\n>So I hope this clears things up for you, you wouldn't want to be spreading misinformation\n\nNone of your comment refutes anything I've said lmao\n\nThe graph intentionally conflates all people living in both the gaza and west bank, including the near million settlers who have illegally moved into Palestinian land",

Displaced from where to where? \n\nNo one is saying Israel isn't mistreating Palestinians or doing horrible things to them. It's just not a GENOCIDE. Is that so hard to get through your head? That genocide is an actual thing, and not just a code-word for \"bad things bad people do\".  You're not helping anyone by calling it a genocide, even if you think you are. And you're definitely not helping Palestinians by doing that.\n\nJews in Israel went through an actual genocide, by an actual regime that wanted to eradicate them and created a system to do so with a master-plan that took several years to implement. They know what a genocide is. So telling them that they're committing a genocide doesn't cause them to stop and rethink, it just makes them stop listening to you and label you as either a clueless idiot or a willing evil who is belittling what Jews went through in the holocaust. \n\n  \nJews were held in internment camps, separated from their families and sent to force labor. Gaza has several malls, restaurants, hotels and Israel tried to let them come in and work for a fair wage. They have a fucking water park. Yes, they're suffering, yes, many are poor there and are locked in with most not allowed to travel abroad ever, yes they have to live with the constant fear of bombing, and yes, Israel has now destroyed a big part of their previous life, ruined their homes, and it will take decades to rebuild. It's horrible. And Israel should pay damages and help them rebuild, the world should help them rebuild and Israel has to start making in ways for peace - now.   \nBut it is not a genocide, Israel as a country does not have any intention of annihilating all the Palestinians, a quarter of which lives in Israel. Some extremists in Israel have that intention, and yes, some of them are in the government right now - and the world has shunned them, but so has the Israeli public. \n\nSo how about instead of creating logical leaps and bending the term genocide backwards to fit here, you instead just call it what it is and argue against that?",

Look, you can sit there and think every single person who is pro-Palestinian is a Hamas supporter for some sick reason but that's not the case. The majority of people who are pro-Palestinian just want emancipation for Palestinians. That's it. \n\nAside from the atrocities from Oct 7, I also don't agree with Israel killing thousands of civilians to try and remove Hamas or what Israel has done to the Palestinians prior to Oct 7. The ratio of collateral damage is insane if you think every single human life is equal. Remember, 1200 Israelis were killed, many of them civilians. The death count in Gaza is at what now, 16000 with more than 50% of housing and infrastructure also destroyed. When will it be enough? What is the correct ratio?\n\n> Maybe we should ask the gazan population to get refuge in a neighbor country... oh wait, none of them want refugees...\n\nOh, so you mean ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza? Because that's exactly what you're asking. That's part of the reason why neighbouring countries do not want to take refugees because it would complete the ethnic cleansing. This is a well-known fact.\n\n> So tell us your brilliant solutions\n\nSimple. End the blockade and end the apartheid and work on a political solution. The only reason why Hamas and militant factions exist is to fight Israel's acts of ethnic cleansing and apartheid. If you think a mass bombing campaign is going to remove Hamas you're out of your mind. Not only is this going to create more militants but will continue to make Jews around the world more unsafe. Look what happened to 20 years in Afghanistan... Taliban the terrorists... back in government. People can't even look at history to see the mistakes we've made. All wars either end in a completed genocide or a treaty. Which one do you prefer? \n\nAs much as you think this conflict is going to be won with bombs... it won't happen. What happens when the bombing and elimination of Hamas is \"completed?\" Does the blockade end? Who governs Gaza? What happens to the West Bank? The only way out of this is politically without killing every single Palestinian. People will say there should be a two-state solution but I don't believe that's possible anymore. In my opinion, it can only be a one-state solution, and my reason for saying this is that in the West Bank in just a few decades the number of settlers went from 80,000 to something like 700,000. How can that be reconciled to pre-1967 borders?\n\nI believe Israel can exist, but it cannot exist as an apartheid state.",

It was suspected that it was because she didn't want to be seen as soft on crime, particularly a crime which involved rape.  \nFurthermore, she was only forced into action by Mulroney meeting with David Milgaard's mother (which she condemned as not being impartial,)  and her decision was to order a new trial.  \nShe blamed the victim for her actions surrounding the case, saying that it was due to his lawyers making new filings.  \nKim Campbell may be our only woman PM, but she is without a doubt the worst person to ever be PM and a disgrace to this country.",

If those costs results in higher taxes for the province to pay for the project then you get citizens who have their power bill raises decades before electricity starts being generated, and the electricity is some of the most expensive.

Although it was known that a new weapon was used, it did not even register as significant in any meetings or breifings at the time. Most Japanese cities were in absolute ruins. So the destruction of another few hundred buildings were irrelevant to Japanese thinking.  \n\nJapanese leaders at the time (well over a year) were seeking to negotiate a ceasefire and even surrender. They knew the war was lost. All of the preparations for a last stand and resistance was not to win a victory but to gain a better negotiated peace with the US. It was central to the Japanese strategy to use the Soviets as a neutral party in these surrender talks. The hope was that the Soviets would act as a counterweight to the US avoiding unconditional surrender and occupation. The Soviets wouldn't want the US to gain such a prize and so, it was hoped, would act in Japan's interest.  \n\nThe Soviets declared war on Japan on August 7th 1945, as they had promised they would to the US. This dashed any hope of salvaging the situation for Japanese leadership. This is what documents show was the discussion of the government and what the deciding factor was in a decision for surrender.  \n\nUnlike the other posters suggest. The US had no way of knowing this or predicting it. So the use of the atomic bombs can, perhaps, be justified. They certainly were not some nefarious plot. No one in the US even understood the significance that these weapons really had. They were seen as simply better and much more poweful bombs. But the dropping of the bombs were almost absolutely not the reason Japan decided to surrender when it did. One could logically assume that if they were not used the result would have been the same regardless.  \n\nSource: Me.

Cells are largely black boxes and we understand a lot less about them once the lid goes on than we'd like. There are many thousands of variables that work together to create a consistent battery cell (one of which can ruin a pack if defective). There are defects that can occur throughout the process from physical ones in manufacturing (cathode and anode touching), back to sourcing (different input metal purity and properties from different sources). We often can't even figure out if we've filled the cells with exactly enough electrolyte slurry. All of these factors (and there really are thousands) influence how we calibrate the machines that run the line, and the smallest error ruins a cell.\n\nWe test the cells in a number of ways, but usually it's destructive to the cell (ripping them apart physically or charging and discharging until death to measure performance). If the sample is bad, we have to toss the whole batch (because why test a whole batch if testing kills them anyway). \n\nThere's a lot more that goes into it, of course, but The point is that it's an iterative process to spin up a battery plant and one that involves a lot of trial and error.

Unless you come here in your 20s or early 30s you mathematically can't pay into the system enough unless you are in the top 10% and even that burden has been shifted to the middle because we have reduced taxation on the capital class in a lot of ways that aren't as clear as simple income tax.

        "body": "This is corporate capitalism blackmail.  Most people don\u2019t know anything about this bill but it has nothing to do with consumers and everything to do with suppliers.  Basically, grocery stores are now big enough they essentially extort suppliers. They dictate what price they will pay and if you don\u2019t agree, good luck keeping your business alive.  And the price is often low enough that smaller stores can\u2019t compete.\n\nThen you get hit with endless fees like storage and stocking and handling and so on and so forth, reducing your pay even more.  Again? You have to suck it up because the contract you signed likely is about as straight as a bank contract where you have absolute demands but they can do whatever they want whenever they want.  Including cancelling or changes rules after ordering, then charging fees for sending the product back. \n\nIn some cases the fees aren\u2019t even up-front.  So you get dinged extra with a bunch of unknown fees that weren\u2019t in the contract and again, don\u2019t like it?  Good luck losing a massive contract and trying to make it selling to a corner store where the prices will be more.\n\nThis has nothing to do with us, the consumers. So why are they making this threat?  Because what they are saying indirectly is that shareholders won\u2019t accept lower profits because they have to give up the exorbitant fees on suppliers.  It will hurt the stock price of our oligopoly grocery sector.  So to keep stock prices up and shareholder happy, those rent/seeking profits have to come from somewhere\u2026and the only place left is hiking  prices.  Which grocery stores won\u2019t do because it really gives up the game and they\u2019re bullish it about fixed margins that haven\u2019t changed in X years (even though they have).\n\nWhat\u2019s even more frustrating for me though is how absolutely stupid people are.  Most will blame Trudeau for this, or government.  But it\u2019s capitalism that sis causing this.  These stores are corporations with a LEGAL DUTY to make as much money as possible every quarter.  The only way to do this is always increase prices, increased fees, or cut labour costs. Capitalism ensures everyone but the rich get a boot to the neck\u2026and then once you get used to it they push even harder.  It\u2019s Orwell\u2019s \u201cboot stomping on a human face forever\u201d and endless idiots (especially conservatives, but liberals too) will pretend like this is all just perfectly normal and definitely not a capitalism problem.

To be allowed to trade green energy credits with companies that have lower emissions would be a boon to them since it would allow them time to build up their emission capture projects without more government regulation. On top of that if the Cap and Trade applies to other countries and States like most of the Northern U.S States plus the European Union, Australia, Korea and New Zealand (as well as apparently Japan may be jumping in as well). That's frankly a good deal for O&G corporations since they can tap into those emission reduction programs faster than they can build their capture projects. You know what makes extracting O&G hard? Variable climate temperatures and lack of water. You know what Alberta is experiencing right now? A drought in it's southern basin due to lack of snowpack. It's almost as if tackling climate change could be useful for O&G companies and therefore the planet. \n\nLet's not even talk about how fossil fuels will be essential in shaping other planets. Mars is a cold desolate place that has very little atmosphere. Could use some Carbon Dioxide and cold resistant trees on the red planet. Burning fossil fuels in cars and to make power when we have respectably better solutions now is wasteful for such a precious commodity. \n\nTo be honest Alberta should be front in center in those programs since they stand the most to gain or lose. I mean the first Carbon tax in Canada was tabled by them, but they simply priced it too low... If they lead the way they could gain significantly since they could become a model of how O&G can still survive long enough for our renewable energy transition to occur.  But if Danielle Smith wants to play partisan politics after we just had the hottest year on record so far on this planet by all means. But come this summer I don't want to hear the Premier bitching that the Fed isn't doing enough while she stands behind her podium as her province experiences another round of wildfires. ***You think a forest fire is crazy? Just wait until you see it move on a dry plain. Those things move at like 14km/hr. Average human run speed is 12.6 km/hr. Which means if you are healthy you can outrun it. If not the fire is so hot (800 celsius) that your blood boils while you are still alive. Since you are running away your feet catch fire first and because it's so damn hot the bone turns to char while you are still alive.*** \n\n*Honestly* ***NOPE.***\n\nShe has tabled the equivalent of symbolic bills that have no positive effect on the daily lives of her voters.  She didn't even expand the **crop loss insurance for Albertan Farmers** or build it's framework out to include ways for rural folk to protect their way of life. Instead she hiked the premium for the farmers costing them more in a season of record drought. But yeah, bitch about the Fed all day everyday while your voters are left without your support.\n\nI mean she has already lost, it's just going to take time for it to sink into her stubborn head.

There's no shame or self-awareness, there are no facts or objective truths they will accept, there are no traditions of civility or ethics they won't break.

That is demonstrably **true** and there is nothing to suggest that the PMO has interfered in Senate independence in any way. Interestingly, the Conservative MP is 100% lying about this.\n2. The second reason the term was applied to Trudeau was because Trudeau is not endorsing the Conservative Bill C-234. Why Trudeau **OR ANYONE** would be branded a \"liar\" simply for not accepting a bill proposed by anyone else is ridiculous. Trudeau might be uncooperative, he might even be getting in the way of the Conservative agenda, but how does this make him a liar? It doesn't.\n3. When you say \"Trudeau is a liar\" regarding this issue, **YOU** are lying. Trudeau has lied about absolutely nothing on this issue, but you are adopting the Conservative talking point uncritically and parroting it mindlessly. The Conservatives are being extremely disingenuous in this circumstance, and yet reddit and /r/canada are once again spinning it as a Liberal failing.\n\nTruly pathetic all around.",

You cannot argue intent to destroy when Israel is warning Palestinians to avoid certain zones to avoid being injured or killed. They're providing humanitarian aid. There is no argument their intent is to destroy Palestinians. They've made it clear their goal is to stop Hamas, and that when they have reached that point this will end. A genocide wouldn't have a situation like that.\n\nOn the other hand, we have Hamas and their stated goal to destroy Israel, to repeat Oct. 7, and that they won't stop until Israel is destroyed.

The SoCons are consistently defeated at every convention. \n\n>Do you think it was by accident that SCOTUS heard the case recently as you said it was an ongoing effort for years to no avail until it wasn\u2019t\n\nThe SCOTUS has nothing to do with Canada. It an American institution and its judges are appointed by politicians. The overturning of Roe didn't make abortion illegal, it returned the powers back to the state and federal level. In Canada provinces do not have the power to ammend the criminal code and could never make restrict or prohibit abortion at the provincial level.\n\n>The other major thing you are missing is that Trump changed the landscape forever. What would have been political suicide and controversial no longer are\n\nDonald Trump has a cult of personality that protects him from consequences. We don't have any such figures. In Canada, if a polarising figure like Trump were elected, his government would be toppled in a vote of non confidence. The American system makes it near impossible to remove a sitting president. Once again, you ignore structural differences our systems.\n\n>What flies in the Prairies aren\u2019t just going to stay there. We are starting to see it in the cities. I see it all the time and it never was in my city previously.  \n\nShow me some data. I don't care about your anecdote. You are conflating the rise of populism on the right and the pro-life movement. There is some overlap but even Donald Trump recognizes how unpopular pro-life policy is and for that reason, he is the most pro-choice Republican candidate running for president. He even said pro-life policy would be a \"mistake\". His appointment of Bret Kavanaugh was a cynical move to gain support from the evangelical Christians but considering his break with Mike Pence and his abortion comments, it's not likely he will work with them like he did last election. \n\n>So bad Covid restrictions caused blockades of cities and partnering with alt right groups?\n\nYes, two years of bad covid policy and divisive rhetoric from Trudeau increased the amount of anger and frustration in this country. The straw on the camels back being the legislation passed to require truck drivers to get vaccinated. Why is it such a shock that people would protest?",

Let's agree that it's there. The SoCons primarily come from rural constituencies. In order for the Conservatives to win, they need both the SoCons and the PCs. Abortion policy would rip the party in half because the PCs are ideologically pro-choice. There is no world in the near future that has the CPC passing abortion legislation. It cannot happen, for the reasons I explained. If you want to disagree, fine, but explain how it's possible and don't just make vague remarks about how populism and pro-life are popular among a minority of CPC members. \n\n>Lots of progressive conservatives are pro life. \n\nThis makes zero sense.

We stand in support of the Ukrainian community..\"\n\nChoosing what sovereign nation and those within it are worthy of support while deeming others 'too political' is also a major indicator of her motives.",

The larger data shows that Palestinians are being killed and injured at a much MUCH higher rate than Israelis. Most of those injuries and deaths in Israel were on Oct 7. Most casualties after that are the result of invading the Gaza strip. \n\nNow, what this should show you is that Israel is actually doing just fine on their own. They have no need for more soldiers, for more money, for anyone's support. They're able to kill and destroy quite effectively. So why you would support a rally to support Israel and to raise funds for them is beyond me. The reason most peole would be against Israel should also be apparent.

Israel then has a choice to either allow 1000's of rockets to keep firing at them or to take out the rockets and Hamas but risk killing civilians. They do some steps to minimize killing civilians such as roof knocking. There was a ceasefire for a few days but Hamas violated it by not releasing female hostages as agreed and resuming firing rockets. You can look all of this up. So generally people don't support purposely targeting civilians and killing them like Hamas did, because how could you. But there is more wiggle room for supporting a country's right to self defense which can result in civilian deaths, unfortunately.   \nAnd for the record, Netanyahu has to go and Israel needs to remove all of the Jewish settlers from the West Bank for any real chance at peace.",

Now, in that same essay, he acknowledged that the forced settlement of Jews in Palestine would be resisted, quote, any indigenous people will fight the settlers as long as there is a spark of hope to be rid of the foreign settlement. That is what the Arabs of the land of Israel are doing and will continue to do as long as a spark of hope lingers in their heart that they can prevent Palestine from becoming the land of Israel. So there's a lot of discussion about Israel as a settler state and whatnot. It's important to note that one of the founders of Israel, one of the most important Zionists in the history of the movement, explicitly described what they were doing as a settler attempt to displace an indigenous people.\u201d*\n\n\nYosef Weitz (another of of the founders of Israel): \n\n>*\"...the transfer of [Palestinian] Arab population from the area of the Jewish state does not serve only one aim--to diminish the Arab population. It also serves a second, no less important, aim which is to advocate land presently held and cultivated by the [Palestinian] Arabs and thus to release it for Jewish inhabitants.\"*\n (Expulsion Of The Palestinians, p. 94-95)\n\nAnchil Pfeffer: \n>*\u201cthe Netanyahu's had no sympathy for the Palestinians. In one of his letters, you only described them as a rabble of cave dwellers fighting for liberty and progress, etc. And in another, he wrote, My national identity is much stronger than theirs.\u2019\u201d*\n\nOr to today: the Nation State Law in which the right to self determination (aka: having rights) is stated only for Jewish people.  This is now in the Israeli constitution. You can look it up.\n\nIn 2018, when Avigdor Lieberman was Defense Minister, he declared that \u201cthere are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip\u201d because \u201ceveryone has a connection to Hamas.\u201d\n\nMeirav Ben-Ari from Yair Lapid\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid: \u201cthe children in Gaza have brought this upon themselves!\u201d\n\nI can get you more examples. There are so, so many more examples. \n\nYou speak of manipulation, which is ironic. Propaganda happens on both sides, but there is a very clear historical pattern and record that the world had largely ignored despite decades of information gathered and many scholars speaking out about it.  \n\nAnd you are glossing over (or maybe just don\u2019t know about) how much Israel has been able to control the narrative much more effectively than the Palestinian side with organizations such as AIPAC. Israel spent over $7m right after Oct 7 on ads alone.  https://consortiumnews.com/2023/11/29/pro-israel-trolls-mob-social-media/\n\n\nThe reason why more people are realizing the Israeli story is bullshit is because now there are social media platforms that allow for real time recording of events from within Palestine.  \n\nGranted, social media can disseminate misinformation at high speeds, but it can also spread facts at high speeds as well. All media can be used like this.

They are the ones with genocidal aspirations, not the Israelis.\n\nIsrael has, by contrast, offered to create a Palestinian state several times. Not only did the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine accept the UN Partition Plan in 1947 (the Arabs did not), but later in 2000 at Camp David and 2008 with Ehud Olmert the Israelis made viable offers to create a Palestinian state. The fact that Palestine is not sovereign today is attributable more to their refusal to share the land than to Israel's supposed desire to \"erase a whole people.\"",

There is substantially more anti-Semites in people who are openly critical of Israel than there would be in the general population, so some of this could be dog whistling.\n\nSo I'm not sure why you're being so skeptical on this. Do you apply this same level of skepticism to all news reporting, or just things that would elicit sympathy for Israel and/or Jewish people? Do you believe rape victims generally?\n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"Montreal police reported a total of 14 and 38 hate crimes and/or incidents against the Arab-Muslim community and the Jewish community, respectively, for the same time period of Oct. 7-25. That is compared to 2022 figures where there was a total of 50 hate crimes targeting religion and 21 non-criminal hate \"incidents\" for the entire year. \n\nIn Ottawa, police recorded 29 hate-motivated incidents for a similar time period of Oct. 7-23. They were not able to provide data from last year, but the majority of those 29 incidents \"are somewhat linked to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza area,\" said Const. Cailey Walker, the service's spokesperson.\n\nIn Calgary, they had \"11 files coming in in relation to the conflict\" in the first couple of weeks after Oct. 7, said Matt Messenger, Calgary police hate crimes co-ordinator. Usually, situations that trigger a spike in hate crimes only have an effect for a few days. But Messenger says these hate crimes don't seem to be slowing down.\"\n\nAs far as I can tell the rise has been disproportionately towards the Jewish rather than the Muslim community. By all means be critical of Israel, there is plenty of reasons to be, but you should really be separating out how you look at domestic issues of hate crime from how you feel about Israel. Otherwise you end up looking pretty anti-Semitic.",

Until they're all back, Israel has every right to take military action, and even afterwards.

That is objectively not what a genocide is, and it is pointless to conflate the two as doing so destroys the meanings of both terms.\n\nLikewise, Palestinians and Arabs have been equally as culpable in taking/targeting religious sites. All of the Muslim and Arab countries have expelled 90-99% of their Jewish populations from 1950-1980s. Approximately 1 million Jews lost their homeland despite engaging in no conflict with their states.\n\nMeanwhile Palestinians actively shoot themselves in their own foot by being hell bent at trying to ethnically cleanse the Jews from the southern levant stemming as early as the late 19th century. It got so bad that a proposal for the two state solution became realized. Yet Palestinians have refused multiple two state offers, rather choosing to maintain the status quo of their violence. One of the Palestinian representatives, Amin al-Husseini, literally cooperated with Nazi germany and consulted with hitler requesting him to bring his \u201cservices\u201d to the southern levant.\n\nIf you are seriously trying to implicate that what is happening with Palestine is anywhere close to the indigenous people, then you haven\u2019t read any of the history of this conflict prior to 1948.

One camp consists of Jews who wish to establish a state, while the other camp finds it to be inappropriate (in accordance with Jewish Law). To expand upon the reasoning for the second camp, from their perspective Jews should remain in a state of exile. This means that Jews should not establish statehood until what is considered their judgment day. Perhaps this fundamental law is a response to the Jews own oppression while being enslaved in Egypt, therefore they may not wish to coalesce into a larger state out of fear of becoming an oppressor themselves. But this is just my own analysis, I could be completely wrong with such an interpretation.\n\nThe aforementioned may be why a lot of Western history depicts Jews as being a marginalized community within larger societies (especially Europe), because they are following the laws of Torah by remaining in exile.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it has been stated that the Arabs, being predominantly Muslim, we're far more tolerant of Jews than the Christians were in Western Europe. So a significant number of Jewish people migrated to the Middle East to establish their own colonies in relative peace.\n\nMatters didn't get complicated until after the first world war once that territory was relinquished by the ottoman authorities. I consider Winston Churchill and his cabinet to be the catalyst to start this rep between the ethnic Palestinians and the Zionists. This really was a political move to give the Western countries a view into the Middle East. In other words it's strategic to have Israel because they are simply our window into Middle Eastern affairs. Otherwise I doubt many Western countries would have invested in the protection and preservation of Israel statehood.\n\nI'm starting to ramble but going back to your point, there are plenty of Palestinian people in the Israeli people who just want to coexist in peace, but their governments are too polarized from one another to find a reasonable compromise. Modern accords and agreements between the two states have been signed but not necessarily have been enforced or practiced upon. For example Netanyahu's government has encroached on strictly demarcated borders of Palestinian territory in order to expand Jewish settlements while simultaneously cutting off any trade or commerce in Gaza. Israeli people are aware of this mistreatment but they are powerless to act against their government since it is so militarized at this point.\n\nBut yes it is okay to condemn Hamas the mass murdering of innocent people but also condemn the actions Israel has done to the Palestinians in the past 20 to 50 years.\n\nI hope this lengthy responses provided some insight for you and if I get downvoted so be it.",

It's quite logical to be antiZionist in the sense that you don't believe Palestine should have been partitioned in the 1940s and that the Jews didn't have a god-given right of return to lands their ancestors left thousands of years ago (yes, a minority of residents in the 1870s was still Jewish before mass immigration took off, but 85-95% of the population was not).\n\nHowever, there is a huge difference between that and advocating the removal of the Jews  from the place they were born (and their parents and sometimes great great great grandparents were born).  Israel exists, and whether you believe 1947 was a mistake or not, in 2023 the elimination of Israel would cause something even more immoral and painful than the Nakba (and no one alive today caused the expulsion of the Palestinians, whereas everyone alive today would bear responsibility for a reverse Nakba).\n\nSimilarly, I think it is perfectly possible to criticize Israel's tactics and decisions made by the government of Israel without being antisemitic or even anti-Zionist.  The theft of West Bank lands was in full swing for years before the Hamas attacks; Israel allowed a right of return to Jews whose ancestors left for Europe when there was still a Roman Empire, but refused the right of return for Palestinians whose ancestors moved 200km after World War II... While there are two sides and a lot of grey areas in between,  Israel's government has done a lot of stuff worthy of criticism over the years.\n\nHamas wanted the war and mass killings of Gazans when they launched their terrorist attacks, rapes, and murders.  It was a strategic move to make Israel into 'the enemy\" of Muslims everywhere and to make sure Israel was seen as a \"baddie\" even in the West.  It does appear to be working.  \n\nI'm in Canada, and we're not giving back the land to the people European and American people stole, extorted, and invaded even 150 years ago; we generally feel guilty and are trying to be more fair, but no one seriously thinks they have a right to push us back into boats to go \"home\", and the people at \"home\" wouldn't let us in anyway.

As a human being, I can't justify eliminating the Jewish presence in \"Palestine\" and can't see any justification for erasing a country that has existed for over 70 years, particularly considering the bloodbath that would result.  \n\nZionism is the belief that the Jews have a special claim on their half (or all) of Palestine because Jews lived there as the dominant tribe/country thousands of years ago - or because God told a prophet it was Jewish.  I wouldn't say I'm a Zionist because I believe Israel just has a right to exist for the same reason Canada or Australia has a right to exist: shit happened, but it's here now and we just have to make the best of it.  I wouldn't label myself as anti-Zionist because it would leave me open to charges that I'm anti-Semitic, but that slur is only possible because Zionists have conflated criticism of Israeli policies with hating Jews.",

[Pogroms were common in the Islamic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anti-Jewish_pogroms_by_Muslims).\n\nBeing a [dhimmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi) was horrible. Jews were considered ritualistically impure by Islamic jurisprudence. Academia isn\u2019t interested in talking about this because of campism. We pretend only Christians were mean to Jews because academia has an axe to grind with the West. The truth is everyone treated Jews horribly.\n\nBelow I've placed [J. J. Benjamin\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Benjamin) writings about being a Jew in Persia. You can find Ottoman primary sources saying the same things:\n\n1. Throughout Persia the Jews are obliged to live in a part of the town separated from the other inhabitants; for they are considered as unclean creatures, who bring contamination with their intercourse and presence.\n\n2. They have no right to carry on trade in stuff goods.\n\n3. Even in the streets of their own quarter of the town they are not allowed to keep any open shop. They may only sell there spices and drugs, or carry on the trade of a jeweler, in which they have attained great perfection.\n\n4. Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity, and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt.\n\n5. For the same reason they are forbidden to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans.\n\n6. If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him so unmercifully, that he falls to the ground, and is obliged to be carried home.\n\n7. If a Persian kills a Jew, and the family of the deceased can bring forward two Mussulmans as witnesses to the fact, the murderer is punished by a fine of 12 tumauns (600 piastres); but if two such witnesses cannot be produced, the crime remains unpunished, even though it has been publicly committed, and is well known.\n\n8. The flesh of the animals slaughtered according to Hebrew custom, but declared as Trefe, must not be sold to any Mussulmans. The slaughterers are compelled to bury the meat, for even the Christians do not venture to buy it, fearing the mockery and insult of the Persians.\n\n9. If a Jew enters a shop to buy anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods, but must stand at a respectful distance and ask the price. Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them.\n\n10. Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever pleases them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life.\n\n11. Upon the least dispute between a Jew and a Persian, the former is immediately dragged before the Achund [religious authority], and, if the complainant can bring forward two witnesses, the Jew is condemned to pay a heavy fine. If he is too poor to pay this penalty in money, he must pay it in his person. He is stripped to the waist, bound to a stake, and receives forty blows with a stick. Should the sufferer utter the least cry of pain during this proceeding, the blows already given are not counted, and the punishment is begun afresh.\n\n12. In the same manner the Jewish children, when they get into a quarrel with those of the Mussulmans, are immediately led before the Achund, and punished with blows.\n\n13. A Jew who travels in Persia is taxed in every inn and every caravanserai he enters. If he hesitates to satisfy any demands that may happen to be made on him, they fall upon him, and maltreat him until he yields to their terms.\n\n14. If, as already mentioned, a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (feast of mourning for the death of the Persian founder of the religion of Ali) he is sure to be murdered.\n\n15. Daily and hourly new suspicions are raised against the Jews, in order to obtain excuses for fresh extortions; the desire of gain is always the chief incitement to fanaticism.\n\nSee also: https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-treatment-of-jews-in-arab-islamic-countries",

You mean a policy change, but in Israel proper there are discriminatory policies that are roughly on par with the laws in Canada vis a vis First Nations people, meaning that some people are exempt from certain duties. For example, FN people are exempt from taxation, and non-Jews in Israel are exempt from military service. I'm not sure what laws in _Israel_ _proper_ could change considering that Khaled Kabub is Muslim and he sits on the Supreme Court, and that there is an Arab party in the Knesset.

This is some real White Man's Burden shit where Kipling wrote that the sullen people were \"half devil and half child.\" They're not. These people are not children and they didn't inherit an intractable situation. They haven't been able to figure things out because both sides are too stubborn or terrified to give up their claim, and money has been flowing into each faction to feed the violence for reasons that are complicated - certainly more complicated than \"evil England,\" which is a ridiculous concept. It's mostly due to various actors (most of whom are not European!) wanting to influence the region on account of how it provides the fuel for all economies everywhere (oil). The money that keeps this conflict going aside, both sides' cultures have evolved as to be dependent on hate: Palestinians have fetishized their victimhood to the point where they have rusted keys around their necks from generations ago, while Israeli settlers are so demented they invent atrocities to justify their crimes, claiming God gave them the land they're stealing.

Why would the Israeli government ever give these people a chance, when every single time they were given one they attacked like a coiled snake? \n\nIt's not pretty, it's not what you want, but that's the truth. If Israel were a rational actor it wouldn't give Palestinians a chance, and it would always opt to keep the people who have historically wantonly massacred its citizens the fuck away from its citizens. Depending who is in power in Israel, the government isn't just rational, though - it's also manipulative and aggressive. It thinks \"we will never be safe with these people here, we should therefore get rid of these people.\" It will skirt the law or ignore it outright like in the Occupied West Bank, and it will start to kill. It's awful, because the Palestinians born into this don't deserve it, and they're not all violent people. But it's rational on the side of Israel, because what else are you going to do? Are you going to sacrifice your people to suicide bombers and knife attacks just so the world can say \"oh whoops, maybe they had a point before?\" and you, in turn, can look like a victim?

Mediaeval Jewish travelers have left records of Jewish communities, and there is evidence of the existence of Jewish agricultural communities, perhaps from the days of the Temple. In the seventeenth century, the illustrious Don Joseph Nasi and his mother conceived the idea of planting Jews on the soil of Palestine. Early in the nineteenth century, Jews from Eastern Europe began to drift in, brought thither mainly by the profound emotion of the bliss of dying and being buried in the dust of the Holy Land. Every Jew who settled in Palestine was a link between the Diaspora and the land of Israel, for it was the duty and the pleasure of his brethren to maintain in Palestine men given up to meditation and study and dedicated to the spiritual life.\n\n>With Sir Moses Montefiore, whose journeys to Palestine began in the eighteen-thirties, Western Jewry began to occupy itself constructively with the Jewish restoration. There was established a fund for the cultivation of land in Palestine by the Jews.\n\nSource: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1919/07/a-jewish-palestine/303393/\n\nThe whole article is fascinating, honestly, and puts lie to the fabricated story that the Jews in Israel are all displaced Europeans following the Holocaust. There are even more quotes about the agricultural schools that were built in the nineteenth century in there, and even then that's just a glimpse into the work Jews put into making land that hadn't been unworkable marshes and deserts for centuries fertile. \n\nFurther, the Jews that came from Europe following the holocaust are a minority; most of those who moved were Jews from the middle East and North Africa who had spent centuries as second class citizens in Arab lands and were forcefully displaced once Israel became an option. So the people there are in majority the victims of what Israel is accused of doing to the Palestinians, in equal numbers. Take those Jews, add in the descendants of those who always loved there + those who moved long before there even was a British mandate, add in the non-Jewish citizens, the Israeli Arabs, and what's left as the descendants of holocaust survivors is hardly as relevant as the narrative would have people believe.",

What about the next paragraph?\n\n>The phrase was popularised in the 1960s as part of a wider call for Palestinian liberation creating a democratic state freeing Palestinians from oppression from Israeli as well as from other Arab regimes such as Jordan and Egypt.[6][7] In the 1960s, the PLO used it to call for a democratic secular state encompassing the entirety of mandatory Palestine which was initially stated to only include the Palestinians and the descendants of Jews who had lived in Palestine before the first Aliyah, although this was later expanded.[8][9] Palestinian progressives use it to call for a united democracy over the whole territory.[10] while others say \"it's a call for peace and equality after ... decades-long, open-ended Israeli military rule over millions of Palestinians.\"[11]\n\nHmm, no mention of Hamas there either. \n\n>This slogan has come under international scrutiny following its usage by various Palestinian factions, particularly since Islamist militant faction Hamas used the phrase in its 2017 charter. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad used it as part of a call for the destruction of Israel and for the establishment of an Islamic state within the same borders.[12][13][14] The slogan's usage by such Palestinian militant groups has led critics to argue that the slogan implicitly advocates for the dismantling of Israel, and a call for the removal or extermination of the Jewish population.[15][16][17][18] Some countries have considered criminalizing its use.[19][20]\n\nThere it is! 2017 you say?

While technically they can be from Jordan, it's like saying Canadian belong in Europe. I don't think these are considered hate speech, but not sure.\n\n>States are by definition a system of political organization. They do not inherently have some right to exist\n\nThis goes both ways, Palestine as a state might not have a right to exist. Palestinians could just live under the Israeli one as they did with the British and Ottomans. People are free to demand the end of said states, but they're taking a chance they'll lose that demand. In that context, \"Palestine should be free\" calls for the ending of the political organization known as \"Israel\", and the creation of a new one called \"Palestine\" based on Islamic and Arab ruling. This won't end well, even if Palestinians will be on the winning side.\n\nI'm not fan of Israel, but there are few things that do bother me; first is the Jewish communities of Canada which regardless of supporting Israel or not should not feel threatened. Same goes to Muslims. Ironically, many of these groups either ran away from these two countries and/or of the left side of the map. Shooting a Jewish school or mosque has nothing to do with what's going on across the ocean. Second is that due to the reason Palestinians are the under dog, they get a free pass. I'm also not a fan of that future country, we see how Islamic countries behaves and their stance on human rights, LGBTQ rights, women rights, religious freedom and democratic values - realistically speaking, I don't think future Palestine will be that good of a place. I guess it's their right to live as they want, but the west shouldn't pay the price. I'm not sure if MIT students fully understands that.

They also found **substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.** A small but statistically significant difference was found in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but **no significant differences were found between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities.** \n\nOC's claim of why DNA testing is banned in Israel seems to be drawn from a backing of \"it's convenient for me to believe this.\"\n\nTha *actual* reason is the same reason why France bans it: [Concerns over paternal status of individuals in the context of a nuclear family.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/father-unknown-a-dread-biblical-status-leads-to-modern-problems/) To further underscore how full of shit this commenter is, Israeli universities have absolutely no issue researching and publishing genetics.\n\n**[Edit] tl;dr Jews are native to the region regardless of what part of the world their families were in diaspora. Israel bans genetic testing for a similar reason to France. This commenter's \"source\" doesn't agree with them. This commenter is just plain dishonest.**",

First of all, these words are not to be taken lightly, meaning that you CANNOT say that everything you disagree with is genocide/war crimes/ethnic cleansing. I can easily disprove each of these accusations against the IDF: 1) The IDF is not doing ethnic cleansing, a simple look at the number of Palestinian Arabs in 1948 and today will tell you the truth; 2) Same goes for Genocide: you can\u2019t have a \u201cgenocide\u201d if your population not only is growing, but thriving; also, you can\u2019t have a genocide when there are no intent to destroy a certain ethnic group, religion or culture, and you can clearly see that Israel is not trying to summarily execute every single Gazan/Palestinian; and 3) to have war crimes you need the intention to commit war crimes to begin with, such as mass executions, chemical or biological warfare, torture, mass kidnapping, mass expulsion and/or mass rape, just to cite a few conducts. When you throw a bomb at your enemy and he happens to build his base near a school or hospital, you didn\u2019t commit a war crime per se; most likely you\u2019ll have something called collateral damage, which is a sad and cold reality in warfare. Not a single war was ever fought without collateral damage, unfortunately. Ask yourself the following question: if Israel wanted to turn Gaza into a parking lot on October 8th, did it have the physical power to do so? Most people will answer a resounding YES, due to the disparity in technology and armaments. Did Israel turn Gaza into a parking lot just after the attacks? No, it did not. Israel showed restraint above anything else. Trust me when I say that the vast majority of Israelis aren\u2019t glad that Gazan children are dying as well, but it\u2019s a sad reality in war.",

Basically you are capped at 38% emissions and if you go over you pay into the system. Another company in the system who is under the 38% emission target can then acquire that funding and use it for development or a company that is going over the emissions target could effectively buy green energy credits to allow them to expand their production. The money they purchase can go to the corporation that has lower emissions so that it allows them to expand their company or they could cash it.\n\nThe major issue with cap and trade is that if you set it too high, companies won't bother, but if you set it too low it won't work. 38% seems reasonable and is embraced by most of the Climate Change Groups in Canada.\n\nIt is emissions bartering to allow corporations to develop their green energy initiatives and it has in fact been in place in multiple places for roughly a decade. If implemented we could once again on a National level  this time be able to do emissions bartering with multiple US states and other countries (The ENTIRE EUROPEAN UNION).

By your logic, we should complain about farmers who feed us because they make money out of producing the food we need to live.\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't decrease our immigration numbers, but even with the current domestic population we're just not building enough housing for everybody due to exclusionary zoning policies, NIMBYism (oh and nimbies will usually employ the exact same narrow-minded argument about \"greedy developers\" that you do btw), and unnecessary municipal regulations such as mandatory parking minimums.\n\nAddressing climate change shouldn't come at the expense of leaving a significant portion of the population homeless or economically choked because of rising housing costs, mortgages, and rents. We can walk and chew gum at the same time, there are so many worthy alternatives to pursue to address climate and reduce our emissions, we can build more nuclear reactors and green energy infrastructure, we can phase out fossil fuels, we can build high-speed rail and focus on building walkable and transit-oriented neighbourhoods to limit the nationwide use of cars, etc.\n\nYes, we unironically should build more housing, especially units from the Missing Middle, and any effort at addressing the housing crisis without recognizing that supply hasn't been keeping up with demand (we built fewer units last year than we did in 1973) is delusional and brainless.\n\nAlso, yes we should reduce immigration but we shouldn't eliminate it, we have to be more targeted and selective with the type of immigrants we not only let in but also integrate into our economy. The best example of this is foreign-trained healthcare workers such as doctors and nurses who can't exercise in most provinces because of a lack of recognition of their credentials. Do you want to reduce waiting lines at hospitals and medical shortages? Then you have to accept the fact that we need to let those tens of thousands of surgeons and physicians currently driving Ubers/Taxis be allowed to exercise legally in all provinces. We also need to invest massively into nursing programs and med schools to open up more spots for future Canadian healthcare professionals and provide them with attractive compensation packages to not lose them to brain drain to the states and elsewhere, but even if we do that there just won't be enough Canadians going into the medical field to meet the demand of our current capacity limits in the short-term/medium-term, so we need immigrants (I can't believe we've reached the point where we have to argue that having more surgeons and doctors is a net positive for the country, y'all have gone rogue on the scapegoating of ALL immigrants it's actually crazy).",

It's not a question of space; it's about making the most of what we've got.  \n>  \n>Blaming immigration or labeling it as a 'human surplus' problem misses the bigger picture. It's an easy scapegoat but doesn't solve anything. Immigrants are often essential to our workforce and economy. The focus should be on building more homes, smarter and more sustainably.  \n>  \n>We shouldn't be shutting doors on new people or the next generation from owning a secure home. Instead, let's open up to innovative housing solutions that match our needs and reduce bullshit red tape that makes us get nothing done.\n\nThat is scripted talking points on top of more talking points.\n\nThis is a math problem. Always has been. If you add 1.2 million new residents you need to build an adequate amount of housing to accommodate that growth. If you do not, you wind up in a housing shortage.\n\nHas nothing to do with red tape. Go ahead an eliminate all zoning laws, and you are still left with the problem of how to go from building 200,000 homes per year to 500,000 homes per year at a minimum. Good luck finding millions of additional trades workers to achieve that.",

This study examines the fiscal pressures, specifically the demand for greater spending on seniors-related programming coupled with a weakened ability to generate tax revenues, that governments will face for the foreseeable future from an aging population.Data abounds illustrating the aging of our population. Statistics Canada estimates that from 2010 to 2063, the seniors\u2019 share of Canada\u2019s population will increase from a little under 15 percent to over 25 percent.Similarly, unlike most of the period from the early 1970s through to 2010 (or so), labour force participation is now expected to decline. Indeed, expectations are that labour force participation will return to its pre-1970s level by mid-century. More specifically, from 2017 to 2063, Canada\u2019s labour force participation rate is expected to fall from about 65 percent to 61 per\u00adcent. This decline is akin to millions of fewer Canadians participating in the labour force.This decline in labour force participation will adversely affect growth in per-capita income.\n\nUsing 2016 nominal GDP figures, the latest year for which we have complete data, this increase would be equivalent to $22.6 billion more being spent on Elderly Benefits.Simply put, population aging will contribute to a large increase in future levels of government spending. When combined, projected government spending increases related to health care and Elderly Benefits are expected to be 5.3 percentage points of GDP higher in 2045 compared to 2017. In dollar terms, this additional spending would be equivalent to an increase of $107.1 billion using 2016 nominal GDP figures.To illustrate the potential size of the looming fiscal imbalance, the study includes an analysis of probable revenues (conservatively estimated) with higher spending on health care and income transfer programs to seniors. Based on certain assumptions, by 2045, it is projected that there will be a 7.1 percent of GDP gap between government revenues and expenditures, in other words a deficit. For perspective, government deficits in 2016 would have been more than $143 billion based on 7.1 percent of GDP. Depending on interest rate assumptions, the accumulation of debt over this period could be substantial. The estimates in the paper of debt accumulation by Canadian governments range between 170 percent and 250 percent of GDP.These rather worrying fiscal outcomes are not inevitable. Proactive steps can and should be undertaken to reform program spending and encour\u00adage stronger economic growth, both of which would mitigate the adverse effects from the aging of our population that are outlined in this paper.",

Immigration isn't a band-aid, it's a necessary move to balance this impending skew. There is a huge lag between population shortage and pension drop off, which is why it's being ramped up will in advance. Brushing off these stats is just burying your head in the sand.\n\n>Ah yes, and the baseless racism and xenophobia accusations arise. I never would have guess after the spiel of talking points and lies.\n\nAvoiding the xenophobia angle doesn't make it disappear. It's vital to spot the difference between an informed debate and bias masquerading as concern. Ignoring this is either naive or deliberately misleading.\n\nYour question about trades workers seems like you're looking for a problem where there's a clear solution.

But even if they were at 2022 levels, they would still need to double, which is totally impossible.\n\nClaiming that doubling housing completions is impossible reeks of defeatism. Canada has a history of stepping up in the face of challenges. Post-World War II, we saw massive government-led housing projects to accommodate returning soldiers and the growing population. In the 1970s, the creation of CMHC facilitated the building of affordable housing nationwide. These were no small feats. Today's housing crisis demands a similar level of commitment and innovation. Dismissing the possibility of increasing housing completions without even trying is not just lazy, it's a failure to learn from our own history.\n\nYou sound utterly lazy and want to accept the status quo like it's our destiny. I am in the industry and actively fight for affordable housing for the next generation against nonstop redtape. Once again, leave the arm chair and actually contribute to solutions rather than \"immigration bad\" on Reddit. The immigrants are here, we can't kick them out.

Perhaps you will dust off the mush between your ears and learn something today.\n\nLet's break down this so-called '75-year forecast' from the Chief Actuary and expose it for the fantasy it is. They're trying to sell us on the idea they can predict Canada's retirement scene for three-quarters of a century? We can't even pin down what's going to happen with the housing market in the next few months, and they want us to buy into this crystal ball gazing?\n\r\nFirst off, their take on inflation, did they really account for how wildly it swings, or are they just making wild guesses? Inflation as we have seen is drastically unpredictable. Then, there's the value of the Canadian dollar. Are they seriously suggesting they know how global economic winds will blow for the next 75 years? That's more than optimistic; it's delusional. \n\r\nAnd let's not forget the cost of living. They're making assumptions based on today's numbers, as if those won't change for decades. That's like using a map from the 1950s to navigate today's roads. Also, do you have any idea the bold guesses they took for demographic changes? birth rates, life expectancy, immigration patterns? as if those things are set in stone.\n\nNow, Economic growth and market returns projections. they\u2019re acting like they\u2019ve got a crystal ball for those. The reality is, economic conditions are more unpredictable than the weather. Political and policy changes? Another huge question mark. Today\u2019s policies might as well be ancient history 75 years from now.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, let\u2019s not ignore the shit that happened within just the past 5 years of global events. Pandemics, wars, technological breakthroughs \u2013 any of these can turn their neat little predictions upside down in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nSo class what did we learn today? this report isn\u2019t a forecast; it\u2019s fiction. It\u2019s a bunch of educated guesses thrown together and presented as some kind of gospel truth. It\u2019s practically palm-reading.

When people first become sick from the virus, they may develop encephalitis \u2014 inflammation of the brain \u2014 causing confusion, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems. COVID also can trigger the onset of new psychological disorders such as severe depression or anxiety. It can even cause people to become psychotic \u2014 to see and hear things that aren't there and to believe things that aren't true. It often damages the brain's autonomic nervous system, leading to abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n> People who were initially severely ill with COVID are at much greater risk for cognitive decline after they recover. Even people who were less severely ill remain at a somewhat greater risk. A large study of MRI scans taken before and then again after people got COVID showed that COVID can actually shrink the brain somewhat.\n\n> Finally, the lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, and difficulty thinking that can last for several years after COVID \u2014 called long COVID or post-acute COVID syndrome \u2014 may well be caused by ongoing low-grade brain inflammation caused by the virus.\n\n> https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-covid-19-damage-the-brain#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20that%2C%20unfortunately,difficulty%20concentrating%2C%20and%20memory%20problems.",

    {
        "body": "> Ok, so where does the money come from for the feds to give out transfer payments?\n\nThese are 2019 numbers. But overwhelmingly everything else, like personal income taxes alone make up just over 50% of the Fed revenue. The other ~20% comes from corporate and non-resident income taxes. EI premiums make up like 9%, GST is like 11%. Then there is just borrowing money, we had like a $30B deficit last year. I am looking into a rather sizeable (~11%) chunk that is referred to as \"other\", so I'll reply again when I find out what that is.\n\nWe have \"have\" and \"have not\" provinces because someone thought it was a good idea to put Equalization of social services into the Constitution. It would exist regardless of natural resource development. Reception of the money mostly has to do with revenue generation in the provinces, but sourcing the money for Equalization doesn't come from the provinces, which a surprisingly large number of people don't seem to understand.\n\n> Why are some provinces allowed to control the distribution of resources of another province?\n\nThey aren't, well unless the \"source\" province gets into an agreement. Example, as I stated in another comment, I was in error, and the Federal Govt does in fact have its own natural resources, they own offshore natural resources, but they get into agreements with provinces to develop those resources, and then they share the outcomes from it.\n\n> Didn't one of the maritime provinces want a pipeline from Alberta so they could make a refinery?\n\nNo, Alberta wanted TC pipelines to create an Energy East pipeline to send dilbit to the Irving Refinery(NB) which would have converted from a primarily light/sweet crude facility to a heavy crude facility. No province stopped that from happening though, it was actually TC Pipelines that shut it down themselves because they didn't want to deal with the hassle of Quebec, who didn't want the pipeline, but couldn't actually stop it, however they could implement delay tactics that would drive up the cost. If TC Pipelines had kept going though, it would have been built, there was no stopping it.\n\nIf EE came up now, and Canada wasn't pushing renewables as hard as it is, I have no doubt it would be built since TMX is dilbit, and KXL is dead, but this time the EE pipeline would probably be natural gas instead of dilbit. It'll be interesting to see what the CPC does if they win in the next election, if EE pops up again, whether or not the CPC will push it will be a fascinating example of what we can expect in the future. Even though I do believe in climate change, I would still support an EE pipeline for natgas, with a modified path to also push gas down into southern Ontario so they don't need to rely on the Line 5? going through Michigan, which their Governor wants to kill, and that pipeline is also in horrible conditions underneath Lake Michigan, another huge problem.\n\n> Didn't we just refuse Germany our natural gas? That was the federal government. Not provincial.\n\nYes and No. Canada didn't say \"no we wont do that\" to Germany, we already do send natural gas to Germany. They want more though, understandably to get out from under the foot of Russia, and we simply told them that it wasn't possible in the timeline that Germany needed. We don't have the ability to do it, even if we wanted to. Building a pipeline from Alberta to NB/NS will cost a lot of money, which investors don't want to invest in unless they know the Fed will fight for them. It's almost completely because of the fear of delays, which costs a shitload of money as you might imagine.\n\nThe current Fed isn't really helping though, if you go through the legislation, you'll start to see that it seems to have been created intentionally to cause delays (rightly or wrongly), but it never really outright stops things in ways that most people would disagree with.",

We have a vast, disparate nation facing challenges of underpopulation AND under-servicing of the population that exists, from underfunding affordable housing and primary health care, to shortchanging education. \n\nThe TLDR is that our electoral system is moribund, our political class is overprivileged, overpaid and brutally lacking in real value, and our choices of leadership consist of either monied lightweights like Trudeau and Singh, or self-interested professional contrarians like Poilevre and Danielle Smith. \n\nMore than anything, Canadian politics needs a humanistic, focussed and charismatic leader, someone who is there to try and lead the country to a greater place, not just to patch holes in a boat with one hand while stuffing their pockets with the other.",

This time period includes a period where food in Canada experienced deflation for the first time in a long time which was certainly in part due to the drop in oil prices during that time period.\n\nHere's where it seems a bit contradictory or cherry picking on Tombe's part to ignore that oil prices had a deflationary effect on food when market prices of oil were down, and it does not look like he compared oil prices and inflation to other countries or normalized oil prices, or created any kind of model.\n\nThe other part of this is, is it really fair that we're basically shifting money from people in higher income households to lower income households purely on this metric alone? The way the rebate is structured at the moment it doesn't really matter how much you as an individual are polluting, its just collectively shifting money around and dolling it out like the rental rebate.

B.C. has had a carbon tax for 14 years \u2014 which, by the way, made it into general revenue.. \n\nYes, it did, at least some of it. They didn't reverse the tax reductions that accompanied the long period the tax was revenue neutral. And when it changed, it was done out loud. Now, personally, I disagreed with both the way the tax was revenue neutral and how it was not. The tax is best implemented in a way like the federal version is.\n\nHis suggestion it inevitably would become prevenue lies to you in two ways. One, the Constitution won't let them. Two, nothing is inevitable. That's just feeding your biaes.\n\n>Is there any real, measurable way to tell if it did.\n\nYes, there is. Before 2015,  BC was compared to nearby jurisdictions that didn't have a carbon tax, American states and Canadian provinces. BCs per capita emissions were dropping. Which is all you could expect with a moderate level of tax. There was also no measured effect on the economy. I've not seen a reason to think that's not continued. Recently, a study came out finding improved air quality due to the carbon tax. That indicates it is having a positive effect.\n\nWhy does the author feign ignorance when the measures are there? Or is it just that they are ignorant. \n\n>Name a tax that makes the taxpayer richer. \n\nFor almost 70%, the federal carbon tax... but not by much as it's a small tax.\n\n>What a strange incentive that would be. Half of Canada would be upping the thermostat, putting the air conditioner on in winter, and driving day and night to burn up oil and gas so that they could get more back than they put in.*\n\nThis bit is beautiful as it demonstrates the writers' complete ignorance or dishonesty. You decide which is worse. That's not how the rebate operates and if you followed the writers' suggestions, you would absolutely be on the road to paying more. Ironically, it would work that way if every Canadian did that, but the biggest emitters would still be losing to the lower end. And some smart mug, maybe a bunch, would figure out that the best way to make more money would be to cut their carbon footprint and let all these 24/7 drivers send them more money.\n\nHow can you supply such a ridiculous piece and think this shows you think for yourself?

The writer forgot that bit. Those estimates have been challenged for ignoring potential benefits as well as generalizing effects that will impact a few to the general population.\n\nThese are things you'll find if you get out from the Conservative media bubble\n\nIt's something to look at in the future.

They fucked up. Arguing that they intentionally let their citizens die is misinformation.\n\n\"None of the American assessments offered any tactical details or indications of the overwhelming scope, scale and sheer brutality of the operation that Hamas carried out on October 7, sources say. It is unclear if any of these US assessments were shared with Israel, which provides much of the intelligence that the US bases its reports on\"\n\nYour own article proves your point wrong. Did you bother reading past the headline?\n\n\u201cThe problem is that none of this is new,\u201d said one of the sources familiar with the intelligence. \u201cThis is something that has historically been the norm between Hamas and Israel. I think what happened is everyone saw these reports and were like, \u2018Yeah of course. But we know what this will look like.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are so many terror attacks and threats from Hamas, none have ever been at that level. Doesn't excuse it, but it's ludicrous to say they intentionally let civilians die.\n\n\"Yet those strategic warnings did nothing to help US or Israeli officials predict the events of October 7, when more than 1,000 Hamas fighters poured across the border into Israel in an operation that would leave more than a thousand Israelis dead. For most US and Israeli officials who were tracking the intelligence, the expectation was that there would likely be just another round of small-scale violence by Hamas \u2014 perhaps some rocket fire that Israel\u2019s Iron Dome would intercept, one source familiar with the intelligence explained.\n\n\u201cIf we had known or if we know of a pending attack against an ally, we would clearly inform that ally,\u201d Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Friday.\"\n\nClearly multiple intelligence people didn't expect it at this scale so it's clear you're wrong that they knew it would be like this and let people die intentionally.\n\nNow I'd like you to answer my questions which you clearly ignored last time.\n\nDo you believe US intelligence was wrong about Hamas?

Are all Canadians not interested in having world class health care and ensuring people are taken care of quickly with the right amount of staff etc. Maybe the issues are more at the hospital management level and boards more than the provinces itself.

This story of the CBC's revelations about the intricacies of illness, unveiled in a time of yore, seems more a figment of imagination than a factual account. Our records bear no such tale, and the whispers you carry seem woven from the threads of fiction rather than reality.\n\nThe accusations hurled at the media's dependence on government funding and alleged control by elusive powers are but shadows casting doubt upon our unity. Let us not succumb to the seduction of conspiracies, for they disrupt the harmony we've toiled to maintain.\n\nTimes change, and winds of transformation sway our world. But let us not paint our truth with the colors of suspicion. Our strength lies not in baseless accusations but in our shared pursuit of knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn this time of uncertainty, let us hold fast to reason and solidarity. It is unity that will guide us through the murky waters of confusion toward a clearer comprehension.\n\nJustin,\nLeader of Animal Farm",

Worth is measured not in the ink that dances upon this parchment but in the unity it seeks to forge among us, the animals of this farm.\n\nThe worthiness lies in the potential to stir hearts, to awaken minds shrouded in skepticism, to bind us in a common cause\u2014the preservation of our home, our sanctuary, our farm.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJustin, Advocate for Unity on Animal Farm",
